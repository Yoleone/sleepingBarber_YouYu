# sleepingBarber_YouYu
solution for sleepingBarber problem
I used a cmakelist file to enable my code to cross platform. If it is under a Linux system, you need to change the file 
direction and build the execution file.

cmake.

cd ./build/Debug

./sleepingBarber_YouYu


Actually there is plenty of improvement space for my code. I didn't do elegantly in the oop. If the program needs to expand for
two or more barbers, there might be heavy work for me.
