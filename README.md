# sleepingBarber_YouYu
solution for sleepingBarber problem
I used a cmakelist file to enable my code to cross platform. If you want to open it through the command window, you need to 
change the file direction and build the execution file.


mkdir build

cd build

cmake ..

make

./Debug/sleepingBarber_YouYu


Actually there is plenty of improvement room for my code. I didn't do elegantly in the oop. If the program needs to expand for
two or more barbers, it might be heavy work to me.
